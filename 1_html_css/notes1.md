## HTML
HTML is Hypertext Markup Language
This language is what is responsible for displaying what you see on a webpage. Our web browser will read this and then
show us what is being written

A very basic html document will usually consist of the `<html> <head> <title> <title> <head> <html>`

There is some logic here, as we have different levels of indents that correspond to the body, title, etc...

We can almost think of this as a nested for loop in python (just with out the loop!)

- We want to write in HTML5 (this is the latest version of html)
- closing tags will always have the `</element>` on them! (opening tags are just `<element>`)
