# HTML, CSS
Course taught by Brian Yu, brian@cs.harvard.edu

## HTML
HTML is Hypertext Markup Language
This language is what is responsible for displaying what you see on a webpage. Our web browser will read this and then
show us what is being written

A very basic html document will usually consist of the `<html> <head> <title> <title> <head> <html>`

There is some logic here, as we have different levels of indents that correspond to the body, title, etc...

We can almost think of this as a nested for loop in python (just with out the loop!)

- We want to write in HTML5 (this is the latest version of html)
- closing tags will always have the `</element>` on them! (opening tags are just `<element>`)

**Head**

This describes things that are NOT in the main body of the page, but other info for the web browsers
They may want to know the **Title** (in this case its hello)

**Body**
This is what the user can see!

To help us think about how this is structured, we can think of this structure like a tree.
We may see the **DOM** or **Document Object Model**

*Remember, indentation is not necessary for it to work right*

The structure can help us understand what is nested under what.

We will continue to work through the different headings, h1, h2, etc..
We also want to look at **Lists** and **Unordered lists**
Basically, this is the MD equivilent to
1) here is one ordered list
2) Here is another one
- This is an unordered list
- another one


Now, lets make something that will display code to display an image
the image tag will have a few required attributes
- need to show which image

We dont need a closing tag on the image!
It is self closing!!

We also need to learn how to start adding links. Brian Yu points out that this is one of the great things and powers
about the internet, is that it can link to otherthings so easily. Lets learn how to do this:
